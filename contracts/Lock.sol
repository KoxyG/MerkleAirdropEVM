//The goal of this assignment is to teach students how to implement a smart contract for an airdrop 
//that uses a Merkle tree for whitelisting addresses. Students will learn how to generate a Merkle root 
//from a list of eligible addresses, implement a Solidity contract that verifies claims against this Merkle root, 
//and manage the airdrop process.
